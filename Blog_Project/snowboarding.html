            <p>My snowboarding adventure started a couple of weeks ago. On the first day, I took 2-hours class from an instructor who showed me a few basics, but I wasn’t really satisfied with the lesson. I had big problems getting up from falls and when I asked him the ways to get up, he said it should just come naturally. Oh well. By the end of 3-4 hours on the first day, I was able to snowboard for a bit, brake and change directions. The biggest problem was getting up from a fall. At one point I was down on the snow for 15 minutes until somebody gave me a hand because I just couldn’t get up. I was told by friends that getting up backwards is easier but at that point I didn’t know how to brake backwards.</p>
            <p>The second time was two weeks ago when I noticed that I didn’t have to put any efforts to get up. It did come naturally like the instructor had said. I learned going backwards a bit and enjoyed snowboarding down the hill without much difficulty. I must have fell about 50 times during the whole day, but it didn’t feel as many as the first time. It was a definite improvement. Learning how to snowboard backwards was the most challenging, but I made some baby steps until we were too exhausted to continue snowboarding.</p>
