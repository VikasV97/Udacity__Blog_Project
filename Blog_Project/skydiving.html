            <p>Crouched in the door of a plane, soaring 12,000ft above the ground, many thoughts may be rushing through your mind. One big thought is how surreal this entire experience is. The world is so far below you that only the biggest landmarks are visible. It seems laughable that you’re actually going to leap out of that door and plummet for nearly a minute towards the earth.</p>
            <p>But jump you do and in that moment you realise that it is one of the most freeing experiences of your life. The rush is impossible to put into words and once you’ve had it you will be counting the seconds until you can experience it again. As you reach terminal velocity (about 195 km/h) the air feels like it has solidified around you. You actually feel like you are flying.</p>
            <p>When you’re under canopy and the rush of free-fall has ended, you have the sky to yourself. Only the wind and the flutter of your slider can be heard. You glide back to the ground and wonder how quickly you can be back up in the sky, throwing yourself out of an aeroplane door.</p>
            <p>I have had 3 skydiving experiences that were truly out of this world for an amateur like me. First was jumping when the clouds closed off completely at about 3000ft. It felt like moving between 2 worlds as I burst through the clouds to see the real ground below. The second was after I had finished my most basic free-fall course and I could jump without having an instructor present for the first time. I had a backwards exit and fell for a while just watching the plane fly away before flipping over and having some free-fall fun. Just lying back in the wind I have never felt so relaxed and at peace with life.</p>
