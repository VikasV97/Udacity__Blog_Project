            <p>My first rock climbing experience was at Lukenya in an area used by the<u> Mountain Club of Kenya</u>. Climbing Map of Lukenya. The year was 1971 or â€˜72, and I was in-country with the U. S. Peace Corp.</p>

               <p> The experience was good. Good enough to draw me into decades of gentle rock climbing. I never graduated to El Capitan or even solo climbing (tried solo once, fell 30 feet and sprained an ankle landing on a scree field.) I did, however move on to some significant mountaineering, climbing to Point Lenana on Mount Kenya, and summiting Mount Rainier, Mount Whitney, and many lower mountains.</p>
               <p>Learning climbing techniques at Lukenya was in the days before climbing gyms and artificial climbing walls. You had to go out to the real thing.</p>

                <p>Lukenya is just off the main highway between Nairobi and Mombasa, Kenya. The easy access from Nairobi was the key to the Mountain Club of Kenya suing the site for training of novices like me.</p>
                <p>I highly recommend having a first rock climbing experience through a club like the Mountain Club of Kenya.</p>
