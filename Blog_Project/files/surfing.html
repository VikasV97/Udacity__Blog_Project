            <p>After many years of thinking about taking up surfing, a few weeks ago, I finally decided to take my very first surf class.</p>

            <p> I’m from Mexico. And yeah, I do know that Mexico is a great surfing destination. So why have I never surfed before? To start, I live way too far from the sea (at least 7 hrs by car) and my chances of frequenting the beach weren’t all that many. </p>
            
                <p> I have tried bodyboarding in the past (catching waves while laying on belly on the board, not that difficult and very fun), but every time I visited a great place to learn to surf for the first time, such as Puerto Escondido or something similar, I would be a bit scared. Long story short, I finally took action and surfed for the first time in Newquay, UK. It was an interesting experience, to say the least.</p>
            
                    <p> Many funny thoughts rushed through my mind during my first surfing lesson. And this is why, here, I would like to share with you my goofy moments and learnings or, as I like to call them, my reflections as a beginner surfer.</p>
